## Why Nephelios?

Nephelios was conceived as part of an ambitious school project aimed at designing a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution from the ground up. 
Our goal was to create an intuitive, self-hosted alternative that embraces the core principles of public cloud PaaS providers while ensuring simplicity and accessibility.

As developers, we wanted to design something intuitive and easy to use for the majority of developers, simplifying the deployment testing process for development environments or static site rendering. 
Our ambition extends to enabling the deployment of various services that can be easily interconnected, allowing for rapid testing and iteration to achieve initial deployment results efficiently.

Beyond the technical aspect, Nephelios is driven by the ethos of transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development. 
By building an ecosystem that fosters innovation, we aspire to make modern application deployment more accessible to everyone.
